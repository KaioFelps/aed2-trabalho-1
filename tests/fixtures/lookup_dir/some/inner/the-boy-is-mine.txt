How can it be? You and me
Might be meant to be, can't unsee it
But I don't wanna cause no scene
I'm usually so unproblematic, so independent, tell me why
'Cause the boy is mine
Somethin' about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over
And God knows I'm tryin, but there's just no use in denyin'
That boy is mine, I can't wait to try him
Le-let's get intertwined, the stars, they aligned
The boy is mine, watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine, boy is
