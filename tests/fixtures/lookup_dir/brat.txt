I went my own way and I made it
I'm your favorite reference, baby

I'll always be the one, ah

When you're in the mirror, do you like what you see?
When you're in the mirror, you're just looking at me
I'm everywhere, I'm so Julia, ah, ah, ah
When you're in the party bum-bum-bumpin' that beat
666 with a princess streak
I'm everywhere, I'm so Julia, ah, ah, ah
Bumpin' that
Bumpin' that
Bumpin' that
